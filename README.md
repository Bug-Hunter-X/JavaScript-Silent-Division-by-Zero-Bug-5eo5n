# JavaScript Silent Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript where division by zero is not explicitly handled, resulting in a silent return of 0 instead of an error. This can lead to unexpected behavior in applications. 

## Bug Description
The `myFunction` function is intended to perform division. However, it returns 0 if either `a` or `b` is 0, masking the division-by-zero error. This silent failure can be difficult to debug.

## Solution
The improved code explicitly checks for division by zero and throws an error in such cases, promoting better error handling and preventing unexpected results.
